You are developing a simple financial advisor tool that helps users decide whether they can afford to buy a car. The decision is based on the user's monthly income, current savings, and the price of the car. The rules for the decision are as follows:

If the user's savings are greater than or equal to 50% of the car's price, recommend "Buy the car".

If the user's monthly income is greater than 20% of the car's price, recommend "Finance the car".

Otherwise, recommend "Save more money".

Input Format:

An integer representing the user's monthly income.

An integer representing the user's current savings.

An integer representing the price of the car.

Output Format:

A string representing the financial advice.

SOLUTION:

inc=int(input())
sav=int(input())
pri=int(input())
a=pri/2
b=(pri/100)*20
if sav>a:
    print("Buy the car")
elif inc>b:
    print("Finance the car")
else:
    print("Save more money")
